Single Sign-on enables you to manage users and testers outside of TestFairy. 
TestFairy supports SAML and is fully compatible with Okta, OneLogin, Ping, Oracle, IBM and Azure ADFS.

When SSO is configured into your account, the login page is replaced with a simple login with sso button.

These are all the [SSO](https://docs.testfairy.com/Single_Sign-On/OKTA.html) integration options available.
