## How to map JIRA custom fields?

First you will need to connect a JIRA account. Follow the [instructions here](https://docs.testfairy.com/Bug_Tracking/JIRA_Cloud.html)

Choose one of your apps to connect to a project and choose the project from the drop down. (this will be filled with your available projects in JIRA automatically)

Press the Test button to validate the JIRA issue creation.

You will get a pop=up window with the response. Make sure you get a valid JIRA link.
In case you get a **PENDING** response check the connection configuration.
