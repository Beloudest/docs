TestFairy's SDK takes your app to the next level. Our tools help you understand how users really interact with your
app. We handle problems like crashes and on-screen error messages, and we even integrate with your current development
workflow.

Some of our features include:

- Record videos and see how your users interact with your apps
- Handle crashes and exceptions
- Sends logs to TestFairy for later inspection
- Identify and tag users, for searching and custom reports
- Use Auto-Update to get your users on the latest version
