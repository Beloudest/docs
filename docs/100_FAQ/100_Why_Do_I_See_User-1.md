When seeing "User-1" as the session User ID, it manes that this session was not identified.

In order to identify sessions, please call the function `setUserId`. 

[See examples for using setUserId](https://docs.testfairy.com/SDK/Identifying_Your_Users.html])

__Before__ calling `setUserId` it looks like this:

![user-1-before](/img/faq-user-1-before.png)

In order to identify your sessions, simply call `setUserId`

__After__ calling `setUserId` it looks like that:

![user-1-after](/img/faq-user-1-after.png)
