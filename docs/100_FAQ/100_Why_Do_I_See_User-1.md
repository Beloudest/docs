When seeing "User-1" as the session User ID, it means that the user for this session was not identified.

In order to identify sessions, please call the method `setUserId`. 

[See examples for using setUserId](https://docs.testfairy.com/SDK/Identifying_Your_Users.html])

__Before__ calling `setUserId` it looks like this:
