### SMTP Integration

In order to increase deliverability and open rates please connect your TestFairy account to SMTP service. This way your users will get emails from a familiar email address, they will be able to reply directly to you, and you will be able to track outgoing messages by checking your Sent Items folder.
This option is recommended for all users and is included in all packages.
