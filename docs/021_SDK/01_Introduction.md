TestFairy's SDK takes your app to the next level. Our tools help you understand how users really interact with your app. We handle problems like crashes and on-screen error messages, and we even integrate with your current development workflow.

Some of our features include:

- Recording videos of how users interact with your apps
- Handling crashes and exceptions
- Sending logs to the TestFairy dashboard for later inspection
- Identifying and tagging users, for searching and custom reports
- Auto-Updates, to make sure your users are on the latest version
