### Shake to create Feedback

When the [TestFairy SDK](https://docs.testfairy.com/SDK/Adding_The_SDK_To_Your_App.html) is defined in your app shaking the device will prompt the user to create a feedback issue from within the app.
The issue will appear with an automatically generated screenshot of the app which can be annotated and a feedback form where details like email and description can be added.

A link to the tester's account is automatically sent to the testers together with the invitaion to start testing your app.

*It is possible to configure your account to automatically post feedbacks into your JIRA, Bugzilla or Github account. In order to enable this feature, please contact our [support team](https://app.testfairy.com/contact).
