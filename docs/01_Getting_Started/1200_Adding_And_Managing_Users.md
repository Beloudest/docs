**Adding and Managing Users**

Use the Team screen to manage your teams members:

![team menu](/img/app/team-menu.png)

There are 3 levels of users in the system:
1. **Account Owner** - the owner of the account. This user cannot be changed and has full control on the account and can add admins and testers.
2. **Account Manager** - can do all actions the account owner can do except adding account manages and removing the account owner.
3. **Admin** - a developer that can upload builds, delete builds, view and delete sessions and so on. 
4. **Tester** - can download builds of apps. See [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/Getting_Started/How_To_Invite_Testers.html).

You can add more admins to your projects by adding their email address and specifying the access level in the Permissions field below.

- The default access level is All Projects (rw). `rw` mean full access - read and write to the project. `r` mean read only access.
     * Permissions are created automatically for each application that is loaded to the system in addition to the `All projects` permission that is for **all applications**.
- If you want a different set of permissions select them from the combinations in the permission windows by clicking on the desired set for each project.
