Now that you have the add-on installed on your server, we will configure it with our `upload API key`. You can find this API key in your **Preferences Page** at [https://app.testfairy.com/settings/](https://app.testfairy.com/settings/).

In your Android or iOS job, create a new task, and pick `TestFairy Uploader` from *Deployment* category.
