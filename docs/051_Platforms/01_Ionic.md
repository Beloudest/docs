Adding TestFairy plugin to your Ionic or Ionic 2 project is simple.

## Install te TestFairy Ionic plugin

Run the following commands from your application root folder:

```
ionic plugin add com.testfairy.cordova-plugin
```

Alternatively, you could install it directly from GitHub:

```
ionic plugin add https://github.com/testfairy/testfairy-cordova-plugin
```

In order to support [remote logging](https://docs.testfairy.com/iOS_SDK/Remote_Logging.html) for iOS 10 devices, you'll need to install the console plugin

```
ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-console
```

## Add TestFairy to your code

Initialize TestFairy with your [App Token](https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken) by calling `TestFairy.begin`.
Your App Token is available at `https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken`.

1. Copy your app token from `https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken`.
2. Open your app.js file (located in your-project/www/js).
3. Initialize the TestFairy plugin in the `ready` method

### Ionic 1.x

```
angular.module('starter', ['ionic', 'starter.controllers', 'starter.services'])

.run(function($ionicPlatform) {
  $ionicPlatform.ready(function() {
    TestFairy.begin("APP TOKEN"); //taken from https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken
  });
})
```

### Ionic 2

With Ionic 2, after adding the plugin to your project, you must first declare the TestFairy SDK in your declaraion file in `src/declarations.d.ts` by adding the line

```
declare var TestFairy:any;
```

Next, in your `src/app/app.component.ts` file, invoke `begin` passing in your **APP TOKEN** which is available at `https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken`. We recommend invoking the `begin` method once `platform.ready()` is invoked as given in the example below:

```
platform.ready().then(() => {
  TestFairy.begin(APP TOKEN);
  ...
});
```

### Ionic 3

With Ionic 2, after adding the plugin to your project, you must first declare the TestFairy SDK in your declaraion file in `tsconfig.json` by adding the line

```
"files": [
"plugins/com.testfairy.cordova-plugin/www/testfairy.d.ts"
],
```

Next, in your `src/app/app.component.ts` file, invoke `begin` passing in your **APP TOKEN** which is available at `https://app.testfairy.com/settings/#apptoken`. We recommend invoking the `begin` method once `platform.ready()` is invoked as given in the example below:

```
declare var TestFairy: any; // at the top of the file
..
platform.ready().then(() => {
  TestFairy.begin(APP TOKEN);
  ...
});
```
