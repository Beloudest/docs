Accessing raw logs on an iOS device requires hooking up that device via a USB cable to a computer. System logs often help a lot in debugging vague problems. 

Many times, the error displayed on an iOS device screen is too generic, but the system logs explain more thoroughly the reason for the problem.

## Using XCode on Mac

* Open XCode.
* Open menu Window -> Devices.
* Select the device which you want to inspect.
* Click on the little arrow toggle button at the bottom of the window.
* A new divider will open up with up-to-date logs from the device.
