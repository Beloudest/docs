## Sending NSLog to TestFairy
The TestFairy SDK records your app being used so you can watch recorded sessions to solve problems faster. The SDK can record videos, screenshots, custom events, logs and device metrics.

This page explains how to set iOS apps to send NSLog to TestFairy (this applies to iOS 10 and future versions).

### Objective-C

**Changing your Prefix Header** 

To enable the app sending logs to TestFairy, you will have to redefine `NSLog` using a macro with the following lines (This macro allows you to continue using NSLog in your code, while also adding the logs to the  matching session in TestFairy).

```
#import "TestFairy.h"
#define NSLog(s, ...) do { NSLog(s, ##__VA_ARGS__); TFLog(s, ##__VA_ARGS__); } while (0)
```    

1. Either add the above line to a global header in your project, accessible to every class file
2. Update or create a Prefix Header (.pch) for your project. If you do not have a PCH file in your project, you can follow the steps in the next section
    
**Creating a new Prefix Header**

If your project doesn’t already include a Prefix Header (.pch), follow these steps to add it:

1. Create a new file under iOS > Other > PCH File.
2. Name your file “PCH file”.
3. Add these two lines of code to the file:
	```
	#import "TestFairy.h" 
	#define NSLog(s, ...) do { NSLog(s, ##__VA_ARGS__); TFLog(s, ##__VA_ARGS__); } while (0) 
	```
4. From the Project Navigator, select your project and the corresponding target.

5. Project > Build Settings > Search: "Prefix Header".

6. Under "Apple LLVM 7.0" you will get the Prefix Header key.

7. Type the path of the file, for example: "$(SRCROOT)/$(PROJECT_NAME)/ProjectName-Prefix.pch". Please note that your file may be at a different location.

8. Make sure the option "Precompile Prefix Header" is set to YES.

9. Clean your project, and rebuild.

That’s it! Your app will send logs to TestFairy.

### Swift

1. Once you've included the TestFairy SDK into your Swift application, in order to automatically gather logs from your app, create a new file named `NSLog.swift`, and add the following to the contents of the file

```
//
//  NSLog.swift
//
//  Copyright © 2016 TestFairy. All rights reserved.
//

import Foundation

public func NSLog(_ format: String, _ args: CVarArg...) {
    let message = String(format: format, arguments:args)
    print(message);
    TFLogv(message, getVaList([]))
}
```
This will print any output to `NSLog` to both the console, and to the active session on TestFairy.
